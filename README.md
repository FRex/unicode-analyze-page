# Unicode Analyze Page

A simple website where you type in a string and get a list of all Unicode characters in it,
their name, value, UTF-8 encoding (including an escaped string for C or Python or similar language),
UTF-16 (to clearly show the UTF-16 surrogate pairs in case of emojis and other non-BMP characters) and Block.

It also displays meaning of CJK characters from the Unihan database, but this is **not** a translator.
No web requests past the original one for the page and data JSON, updates in real time.

To see it in action go to [https://frex.github.io/unicode.html](https://frex.github.io/unicode.html).
Some examples:

1. [abc](https://frex.github.io/unicode.html?text=abc)
2. [espa√±ol](https://frex.github.io/unicode.html?text=espa%C3%B1ol)
3. [üòÄüòÅüòé](https://frex.github.io/unicode.html?text=%F0%9F%98%80%F0%9F%98%81%F0%9F%98%8E)
4. [üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶](https://frex.github.io/unicode.html?text=%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%91%A9%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%91%A7%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%91%A6)
5. [Êó•Êú¨Ë™û](https://frex.github.io/unicode.html?text=%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E)
6. [—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫](https://frex.github.io/unicode.html?text=%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA)

**NOTE**: precomposed Hangul characters (link 7. above) have no names listed, but the block is listed correctly as `Hangul Syllables`.
Characters from other blocks (`Hangul Jamo`, `Hangul Compatibility Jamo`, `Hangul Jamo Extended-A`, and `Hangul Jamo Extended-B`)
have names listed. This is how Unicode zip files list the data about these characters. I might try to do something about it
in the future to provide readings/romanization of syllables for precomposed Hangul.


# Usage

To deploy this tool yoursef you need the three files:

1. `index.html` - the HTML with input box and inline JS to analyze the string.
2. `data.js` - the data as JSON, generated from `UCD.zip` and `Unihan.zip` files.
3. `blocks.js` - the data as JSON, generated from `UCD.zip` file.

All the files and the `gendata.py` script that generates `data.js` and `blocks.js` are in this repo.

To get the `UCD.zip` and `Unihan.zip` files, visit
[https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/).

You don't need to unpack them, just drop them in same directory as `gendata.py`
and run it, to generate `data.js` and `blocks.js`. The meaning of CJK characters is taken from `kDefinition` field.


# Other

Other tools to deal with Unicode strings, analyze them, convert them, etc. (some of these descriptions might be outdated since I've checked them once in the past, check yourself if you want to be doubly sure):

1. [https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer](https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer) - updates
in real time, but the first time character appears it takes a split second to load its info. It also
only lists the codepoint of CJK characters, but not their meanings. Provides the link with your input
prefilled but it's not plaintext in the URL (it looks base 64 encoded, which for Unicode input makes it shorter in URL than URL encoding done by browser). Does a request for every update if there are new characters
not previously seen in the input (but this data is cached so typing `ab` does 2 requests, and `aa` just 1).
2. ~~hxxps://unicodemap.org/search.asp - limit of 1000 characters,
splits non-BMP characters (e.g. emojis) into surrogate pairs, doesn't update in real time, has no
CJK character meaning. Provides a link with your input prefilled.~~
Dead and redirects to some sports website as of February 2025.
3. [https://devina.io/unicode-analyser](https://devina.io/unicode-analyser) - updates in real time,
has more info than just codepoint values, fast, but still no CJK meaning data. Until late 2022 it
had no way to make a link that leads to the page and has prefilled input.
4. [https://freetools.textmagic.com/unicode-detector](https://freetools.textmagic.com/unicode-detector) - updates
in real time, shows you what characters might cause problems and be encoded in longer encodings in SMS text messages.
5. [https://www.soscisurvey.de/tools/view-chars.php](https://www.soscisurvey.de/tools/view-chars.php) - requires
a click to execute, shows non-printable characters hidden in the string, but nothing else.
6. [https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/search.htm](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/search.htm) - requires a click to excute, can only search one character a time it seems (or you can search by Unicode code for some specific character). **Includes CJK meaning**.
7. [https://r12a.github.io/app-analysestring/index.html](https://r12a.github.io/app-analysestring/index.html) - requires a click to execute, and does web request to get high res picture of non-CJK characters. **No CJK meaning, but for CJK provides Unihan Unicode database link, which has this and other information.**
8. [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicode-analyzer/pipjflhdnjcdflbkmoldkkpphmhcfaio](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicode-analyzer/pipjflhdnjcdflbkmoldkkpphmhcfaio) - Chrome extension, lots of information provided on the
tab that opens for analysis, convenient for existing web page, but to analyze own string you need to edit the URL or get
it typed into some input box on another website first. No CJK meaning.
9. [https://www.branah.com/unicode-converter](https://www.branah.com/unicode-converter) - no character information or CJK
meaning, but converts given string in realtime to many UTF- encodings, big and little endian, percent encoding, etc.
10. [https://decodeunicode.org](https://decodeunicode.org) - modern and fast German made website, with a nice search, showing blocks, languages (named in German for example Japanese is Japanisch), properties, etc. of the characters, but no CJK meaning.
